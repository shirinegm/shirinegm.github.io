  <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag <br>
    clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian <br>
    child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical <br>
    helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what <br>
    you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, <br>
    because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.<br>
